# Application Overview
In  our toll gate systems, each vehicle would be required to 
stop at the entrance to acquire permission to proceed and also stop at the exit to pay the bills.
This would lead to a possible congestion (traffic)  and a delay in time at these two instances.
This project proposes an efficient solution to this problem.

In this project, two cameras will be positioned both at the entrance and exit. The camera at the entrance would be used to identify the vehicles while the same vehicles would be re-identified using the camera positioned at the exit.

Due to this, the need to stop would be only on one occastion. Thus, the traffic  and the waiting time could be minimised.

The classification of the vehicles would be performed primarily focusing only on their appearences, setting aside the detection using number plate recognition approach.
